Here is a step by step instruction on how to generate the bundler.

Prerequisites:
a. Make sure phantomjs is installed and added to path.
b. Make sure you have a folder node_modules that for phantomjs to work.

Main steps:
1. Open the terminal in the main location (where you have the bundler, exams, etc. folders).
2. Type "jupyter nbconvert --config bundler/bundle_configuration.py"
3. Select which bundle you want to make, type "1" for lecture notes, "2" for prob-prog, etc.
4. Wait until everything has run, and you get the message "Completely done! Check the output folder."
5. Go to the output folder, and there should be the rendered PDF.

Known issues:
1. When bundling, make sure you do not have the PDF bundle at the save location open.
   Else, the file cannot be overwritten as it is already open.
2. Issues with requiring modules (e.g. require 'toc'). This is an issue with the node_modules.
   Make sure that you have the correct modules installed at the correct location.
3. Issues with phantomjs. Make sure you have phantomjs installed.
   Furthermore, phantomjs should be added to the PATH variable.
   When you type "phantomjs" in the terminal, the terminal should become dark grey.
   If it says the command is not found, then there is a problem with installing it.
