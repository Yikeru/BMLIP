    "Let $\\Omega$ be a set of possible outcomes of an experiment. Let $\\mathcal{F}$ be a collection of subsets of $\\Omega$ that are closed under countable unions. What could be properties that allow us to define a probability function $P \\colon \\mathcal{F} \\to [0,1]$? If we remove the constraint that $\\mathcal{F}$ is not closed under countable unions, can we define a probability function? "

    "In an experiment involving two events, $A$ and $B$ are known to have $P(A) = 0.5$ and $P(B) = 0.65$. It is suspected that these two events can be independent. However $P(A \\cap B)$ can not be determined by means of theory. So you run an experiment $500$ times and record that $A \\cup B$ occurs 497 times. What would you conclude regarding independence between $A$ and $B$?"
